Step 2: Database Interaction
2.1 Choose a Node.js MySQL Driver

Decide between using a simple MySQL driver like mysql2 or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) like sequelize.
2.2 Install the Chosen Package

Run npm install mysql2 for a simple MySQL driver or npm install sequelize for using Sequelize.
2.3 Initialize Database Connection

Create a new file (e.g., database.js) in your project.
In this file, initialize a connection to your MySQL database. The initialization will vary depending on whether you chose mysql2 or sequelize.
2.4 Connection Credentials

Use environment variables to securely store your database credentials. You can use a .env file along with the dotenv package to achieve this.
2.5 Test the Connection

Write a simple piece of code to test whether the connection to the database is successful. Log the result to the console for confirmation.
2.6 Define Database Models/Schemas

Refer to your existing PHP implementation to understand the structure of the tables.
Create model or schema files (e.g., userModel.js, orderModel.js) that define the shape of your data.
2.7 Synchronize Models with Database

If you're using Sequelize, you may need to sync your models with your database. This will create the necessary tables if they don't already exist.
For mysql2, you may need to execute raw SQL queries to create the tables.
2.8 Basic CRUD Operations

Write basic Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functions in your model files.
These functions should interact with your database, performing operations like inserting data, querying data, updating data, and deleting data.
2.9 Data Validation

Ensure that the data being saved to the database is valid. Use model validation methods to enforce data integrity.
2.10 Test Models/Schemas

Write some test code or use Postman to ensure that your models or schemas are functioning as expected.
